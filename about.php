             <h4> Dr. Lenin Gopal </h4>
             <p><font style="opacity:.7;"> PhD., M.Eng., B.Eng., C.Eng.</font></p>

                <comment>The IEEE provides a platform to its members to bring into practice technical skills and engineering

                knowledge in order to project mundane ideas onto infinite dimensional spaces of reality. This can only

                be realized when an IEEE member is willing to become an agent-of- change and to develop a capability of

                transforming complexity into simplicity. Determination and consistency to thrive such characters

                assume continual and effective communication and cooperation among IEEE members. Indeed, closed-

                loop communication, planning and execution of ideas with feedback and creative management will only

                strengthen IEEE despite the presence of disturbances and uncertainties.<br><br>

                The presence of the IEEE Student Branch on our campus has undoubtedly significant and beneficial for

                Curtin Sarawak as well as external communities. I would therefore like to invite and call for greater

                participation of Curtin Students in IEEE activities, no matter how ad-hoc it would be. University life is

                your precious moment, if not the only one, to grow your talents and affection towards humanity. This

                can certainly be done by extending your learning venues beyond classrooms and by becoming an active

                player, not merely a spectator. Let's join and journey together with the IEEE Student Branch to utilize

                    technological advancement for the better future!
